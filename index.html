    <h1>My Aspirations</h1>

    <h3>Aspirations: Hope or ambitions of acheiving something</h3>
    <p>I always dream about becoming a scientist. But being a scientist is not so easy. The same needs a lot of patience and one needs to learn the art of embracing failure as success nearing soon.

        When I enjoy my Science lessons in school, I use to think it is a great enjoyment to stay in touch with the nature. This has pointed out my deep love on Science and that is why I wish to establish my career in the field of Science.
        
        Right from this stage, I am learning to do both hard work and smart work.  I have never stopped asking questions during my Science classes since I strongly believe that by questioning we get the right answers. I want to invent new things for mankind and bring out the unrevealed secrets of nature.
        
        By making ourselves, close to Science we make ourselves close to nature. I want to explore the environment and help people to live a better life as a Scientist in future. I want to prove that a Scientist is a selfless person who toils for the benefit of fellow human beings. I want to set an example to others. I do not believe that life is a successful journey until we mark our footprints in history.
        
        My ambition is very important for me and working hard for it everyday. When I become a Scientist, I am sure my parents and teachers would be proud of me.</p>
